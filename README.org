* READ PLEASE
This is fork just removes =Makefile= because otherwise I wouldn't package it for NixOS however funny that sounds.

If you want to install cp-p on NixOS then:
1. In the same directory as =configuration.nix= make a file called =cp-p.nix= and paste contents from below into that file
#+begin_src nix
{ pkgs }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "cp-p";
  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "deadendpl";
    repo = "nix-cp-p";
    rev = "414f7983dfd3abe8048363b2ca1019472802c5b5";
    sha256 = "1vfjx3xh58ihll1sz3v3dmwjag9s0j50gxdzpql6frl1ilrdpwli";
  };
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out/bin
    cp cp-p mv-p $out/bin/
  '';
}
#+end_src
2. In your =configuration.nix= add that file to =enironment.systemPackages=
#+begin_src nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  (import ./cp-p.nix { inherit pkgs; })
  # wget
  # ...
#+end_src
3. Reload your NixOS configuration with =sudo nixos-rebuild switch=.

* cp-p: Unix cp (and mv), with progress
  As the title says... cp and mv that shows progress.

** How does it look like?
   Something like this
   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
     $ cp-p foo bar
     44% (302.99 MiB/684.51 MiB, 60.60 MiB/s, ETA: 6.3s) foo to bar
   #+END_SRC

** Installation
   #+begin_src shell
     sudo make install
   #+end_src

** Usage with ~lf~
   Add the following to ~/.config/lf/lfrc
   #+begin_src fundamental
     cmd paste $cp-p --lf-paste $id
   #+end_src
